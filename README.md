Hello there! This is my first game as a Web Development project. It is called a Color Game.

The goal in this game is to guess a color an RGB Color that consists of 3 parameters: red, green, blue.

I was really struggling with the RGB system in the beginning and couldn't find any solution to memorize them quickly. This was why I decided to make this project. 

In this game you can:

1) 
2) 
3) 
4) 

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) JS,
4) and jQuery

This is a small app that I made during the Web development course from Colt Steele at Udemy. The main idea behind this project was to get more comfortable with jQuery DOM methods instead of using the vanilla JS. 

The page is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen. 
Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
