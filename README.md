Hello there! This is my first game as a Web Development project. It is called a Color Game.

The goal here is to guess an RGB Color that consists of 3 parameters: red, green and blue.
I was really struggling with the RGB system in the beginning and couldn't find any solution to memorize the way that colors are built quickly. This is why I decided to make this project.

In this game you can play 4 modes: easy, hard, extreme and god. The difference between them is from how many squares (=colors) you have to choose the correct one
The features of this game are:

1) the guessing game itself (from 3 colors in the easy mode to 12 colors in God version). In the beginning of the game 3 to 12 colors are randomly generated and are represented through the squares. By clicking on them a user can either win the game or eliminate the wrong option and keep playing.

2) "Play Again" and "New colors" functions. When the game is over, a user can press the "Play Again" button to play the game one more time.
Besides when playing a game, a user can get random new colors by pressing "New colors" button in the left top corner.

3) By clicking on a new difficulty mode, the game generates the random colors. The number of the random generated squares with colors always matches the difficulty mode.

4) If a user clicks on a wrong square, it disappears. That leaves fewer options to choose with every choice the player makes. In fact the square isn't removed from the screen. Its color is just turned into the background color and a user cannot see it. However, it still exists in the HTML.

5) After the game is finished and the right color is guessed, all the squares and the header of the page turn into the color of the correct color

The app is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) and JS

This is a small app that I made during the Web development course from Colt Steele at Udemy. The original project had only 2 modes: easy and hard, which didn't seem that fun to me. So I decided add some extra features such as extreme and god modes.

The page is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen. 
Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
